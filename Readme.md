# Sentimental analysis for IMDB reviews using RNN LSTM architecture -> CPU approach

## Prerequisites:

-> You have Anaconda already installed in your system

-> conda package manager is installed

-> pip is installed correctly, make sure you check step  1 and 2 of trouble shoot for correct pip installation 

->Downloading data from: 
  http://files.fast.ai/data/aclImdb.tgz

cd into Sentimental analysis IMDB  folder 

-> sudo conda env update -f environment-cpu.yml 

The above command creates a environment "fastai-cpu-dev" in your anaconda.

for activating newly creating environment:

-> source activate fastai-cpu-dev


## Opening Jupyter notebook

run "jupyter notebook" in your fast-ai-cpu environment, it will look something like this:

(fastai-cpu-dev) âžœ  Sentimental analysis IMDB  jupyter notebook


## Trouble Shooting

conda install -c anaconda bcolz

### Steps to make your pip default to anaconda environment:
